        <h4>Overall</h4>
        Entity "Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd" is the Company responsible for issuance of tokens.
        <h4>Important Notice</h4>
        The CONSENTIUM TOKENS are not securities or units in a collective investment scheme or
        business trust, each as defined under Singapore's Securities and Futures Act (Cap. 289)
        ("<b>SFA</b>"). Accordingly, the SFA does not apply to the offer and sale of the CONSENTIUM
        TOKENS. For the avoidance of doubt, this initial offering of CONSENTIUM TOKENS need
        not be accompanied by any prospectus or profile statement and no prospectus or profile
        statement needs to be lodged with the Monetary Authority of Singapore ("<b>MAS</b>").
        This [White Paper/Crowdsale Document/business deck] does not constitute an offer of, or an
        invitation to purchase, the CONSENTIUM TOKENS in any jurisdiction in which such offer or
        sale would be unlawful. No regulatory authority in Singapore, including the MAS, has
        reviewed or approved or disapproved of the CONSENTIUM TOKENS or this [White
        Paper/Crowdsale Document/business deck]. This [White Paper/Crowdsale
        Document/business deck] and any part hereof may not be distributed or otherwise
        disseminated in any jurisdiction where offering tokens in the manner set out this [White
        Paper/Crowdsale Document/business deck] is regulated or prohibited.
        The information in this [White Paper/Crowdsale Document/business deck] is current only as
        of the date on the cover hereof. For any time after the cover date of this [White
        Paper/Crowdsale Document/business deck], the information, including information
        concerning Asia Focus Group Pte Ltdâ€™s business operations and financial condition may
        have changed. Neither the delivery of this [White Paper/Crowdsale Document/business
        deck] nor any sale made in the related initial token offering shall, under any circumstances,
        constitute a representation that no such changes have occurred. Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd
        does not make or purport to make, and hereby disclaims, any representation, warranty,
        undertaking, or other assurance in any form whatsoever to any person, including any
        representations, warranties, undertakings, or other assurances in relation to the truth,
        accuracy, or completeness of any part of the information in this[White Paper/Crowdsale
        Document/business deck].
        Whether taken as a whole or read in part, this [White Paper/Crowdsale Document/business
        deck] is not, and should not be regarded as, any form of legal, financial, tax, or other
        professional advice. You should seek independent professional advice before making your
        own decision as to whether or not to purchase any CONSENTIUM TOKENS. You are
        responsible for any and all evaluations, assessments, and decisions you make in relation to
        investing in the CONSENTIUM TOKENS. You may request for additional information from
        Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd in relation to this offer of CONSENTIUM TOKENS. Asia Focus
        Group Pte Ltd may, but is not obliged to, disclose such information depending on whether (i)
        it is legal to do so and (ii) the requested information is reasonably necessary to verify the
        information contained in this [White Paper/Crowdsale Document/business deck].
        CONSENTIUM TOKENS are intended for use within applications available on the Asia
        Focus Group Pte Ltd Network for purposes stated in the White Paper and Asia Focus Group
        Pte Ltd warrants that the CONSENTIUM TOKENS are fit for these purposes.
        However, Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd is not responsible for compelling any person to accept
        CONSENTIUM TOKENS and disclaims, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all liability for
        any adverse consequences arising out of or in relation to such rejections of CONSENTIUM
        TOKENS.
        Upon purchasing any CONSENTIUM TOKENS, you will be deemed to have reviewed this
        [White Paper/Crowdsale Document] (and any information requested and obtained from Asia
        Focus Group Pte Ltd) in full and to have agreed to the terms of this offering of
        CONSENTIUM TOKENS, including to the fact that this offering does not fall within the scope

        of any securities laws in Singapore and is not regulated by the MAS. You further
        acknowledge and agree that the CONSENTIUM TOKENS are not securities and are not
        meant to generate any form of investment return.
        The CONSENTIUM TOKENS and related services provided by Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd (if
        any) are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd does not
        grant any warranties or make any representation, express or implied or otherwise, as to the
        accessibility, quality, suitability, accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of the CONSENTIUM
        TOKENS or any related services provided by Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd, and expressly
        disclaims any liability for errors, delays, or omissions in, or for any action taken in reliance
        on, the CONSENTIUM TOKENS and related services provided by Asia Focus Group Pte
        Ltd. No warranty, including the warranties of non-infringement of third party rights, title,
        merchantability, satisfactory quality, or fitness for a particular purpose, is given in
        conjunction with the CONSENTIUM TOKENS and any related services provided by Asia
        Focus Group Pte Ltd.
        <h4>Token Disclaimer</h4>
        The Consentium Coin tokens are not securities under Singapore's Securities and Futures
        Act (Cap 289) ("SFA"). They grant holders access to certain services within the
        Consentium ChatApp ecosystem. They are utility tokens whose entire value derives from
        the services provided by the Consentium ChatApp Network in exchange for holding or
        consumption of the tokens, as detailed here. They are not intended for speculation and hold
        no rights to intellectual or other property or cash flows. They are not equities, as they do not
        provide any fractional ownership rights in the company and no claim in decision making over
        company assets or strategy. There is no promise of value or claim on revenue associated
        with the Consentium Coin tokens, similar to debentures, other than that derived from
        platform usage. In short, PPN tokens are not equities, debentures or any form of securities
        as defined under the SFA.
        <h4>Regulatory Risks</h4>
        The regulation of tokens such as the CONSENTIUM TOKENS is still in a very nascent stage
        of development in Singapore. A high degree of uncertainty as to how tokens and token-
        related activities are to be treated exists. The applicable legal and regulatory framework may
        change subsequent to the date of issuance of this [White Paper/Crowdsale Document].
        Such change may be very rapid and it is not possible to anticipate with any degree of
        certainty the nature of such regulatory evolution. Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd does not in any
        way represent that the regulatory status of the CONSENTIUM TOKENS will remain
        unaffected by any regulatory changes that arise at any point in time before, during, and after
        this offering.
        <h4>Tax Risks</h4>
        The tax characterization of CONSENTIUM TOKENS is unclear. Accordingly, the tax
        treatment to which they will be subject is uncertain. All persons who wish to purchase
        CONSENTIUM TOKENS should seek independent tax advice prior to deciding whether to
        purchase any CONSENTIUM TOKENS. Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd does not make any
        representation as to whether any tax consequences may arise from purchasing or holding
        CONSENTIUM TOKENS.
        <h4>Risk From Third Parties</h4>

        The tokenised nature of CONSENTIUM TOKENS means that they are a blockchain-based
        asset. The security, transferability, storage, and accessibility of blockchain assets depends
        on factors outside of Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd's control, such as the security, stability, and
        suitability of the underlying blockchain (in this case, the Ethereum blockchain), mining
        attacks, and who has access to the private key of a wallet where CONSENTIUM TOKENS
        are stored. Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd is unable to assure that it can prevent such external
        factors from having any direct or indirect adverse impact on any of the CONSENTIUM
        TOKENS. Persons intending to purchase CONSENTIUM TOKENS should note that adverse
        events caused by such external factors may results in the loss of some or all CONSENTIUM
        TOKENS purchased. Such loss may be irreversible. Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd is not
        responsible for taking steps to retrieve CONSENTIUM TOKENS lost in this manner.
        <h4>Risks in purchasing CONSENTIUM TOKENS</h4>
        Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd cannot and does not guarantee or otherwise assure that there are
        no risks in relation to your purchase of CONSENTIUM TOKENS. The purchase of
        CONSENTIUM TOKENS may, depending on the manner in which the relevant purchase is
        effected, involve third parties or external platforms (e.g., wallets). The involvement of such
        parties or platforms may introduce risks that would not otherwise be present, such as
        misconduct or fraud by the third party, or your failure to receive CONSENTIUM TOKENS
        upon duly making payment because of a third-party wallet's incompatibility with
        CONSENTIUM TOKENS. Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd is not responsible for any risks arising
        due to the involvement of third parties, including the risk of not receiving (or subsequently
        losing) any or all CONSENTIUM TOKENS you attempt to (or successfully) purchase.
