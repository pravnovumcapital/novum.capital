They are not intended for speculation and hold no rights to intellectual or other property or cash flows. &nbsp;They are not equities, as they do not provide any fractional ownership rights &nbsp;in the company and no claim in decision making over company assets or strategy. There is no promise of value or claim on revenue associated with the Bountie Coin tokens, similar to debentures, other than that derived from platform usage. In short, PPN tokens are not equities, debentures or any form of securities as defined under the SFA.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.h39arzqjqjk6"><span class="c5">Regulatory Risks</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The regulation of tokens such as the BOUNTIE TOKENS is still in a very nascent stage of development in Singapore. A high degree of uncertainty as to how tokens and token-related activities are to be treated exists. The applicable legal and regulatory framework may change subsequent to the date of issuance of this [White Paper/Crowdsale Document]. Such change may be very rapid and it is not possible to anticipate with any degree of certainty the nature of such regulatory evolution. Bountie Pte Ltd does not in any way represent that the regulatory status of the BOUNTIE TOKENS will remain unaffected by any regulatory changes that arise at any point in time before, during, and after this offering.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.g4wy6kk9tolu"><span class="c5">Tax Risks</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The tax characterization of BOUNTIE TOKENS is unclear. Accordingly, the tax treatment to which they will be subject is uncertain. All persons who wish to purchase BOUNTIE TOKENS should seek independent tax advice prior to deciding whether to purchase any BOUNTIE TOKENS. Bountie Pte Ltd does not make any representation as to whether any tax consequences may arise from purchasing or holding BOUNTIE TOKENS.</span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.j70rjnplfmn0"><span class="c5">Risk From Third Parties</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The tokenised nature of BOUNTIE TOKENS means that they are a blockchain-based asset. The security, transferability, storage, and accessibility of blockchain assets depends on factors outside of Bountie Pte Ltd&rsquo;s control, such as the security, stability, and suitability of the underlying blockchain (in this case, the Ethereum blockchain), mining attacks, and who has access to the private key of a wallet where BOUNTIE TOKENS are stored. Bountie Pte Ltd is unable to assure that it can prevent such external factors from having any direct or indirect adverse impact on any of the BOUNTIE TOKENS. Persons intending to purchase BOUNTIE TOKENS should note that adverse events caused by such external factors may results in the loss of some or all BOUNTIE TOKENS purchased. Such loss may be irreversible. Bountie Pte Ltd is not responsible for taking steps to retrieve BOUNTIE TOKENS lost in this manner.</span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.rzope2jixfk1"><span class="c5">Risks in purchasing BOUNTIE TOKENS</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Bountie Pte Ltd cannot and does not guarantee or otherwise assure that there are no risks in relation to your purchase of BOUNTIE TOKENS. The purchase of BOUNTIE TOKENS may, depending on the manner in which the relevant purchase is effected, involve third parties or external platforms (e.g., wallets). The involvement of such parties or platforms may introduce risks that would not otherwise be present, such as misconduct or fraud by the third party, or your failure to receive BOUNTIE TOKENS upon duly making payment because of a third-party wallet&rsquo;s incompatibility with BOUNTIE TOKENS. Bountie Pte Ltd is not responsible for any risks arising due to the involvement of third parties, including the risk of not receiving (or subsequently losing) any or all BOUNTIE TOKENS you attempt to (or successfully) purchase.</span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.tvecy58kjgle"><span class="c5">Disclaimer [Private Investor Deck]</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The information and opinions in this presentation are for general guidance only.
